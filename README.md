## Project Overview

This assignment includes a set of JavaScript solutions covering a range of tasks from mathematical calculations to sorting and data operations. Each question is interactive, providing hands-on experience with JavaScript fundamentals, such as loops, conditionals, and functions.

## Practical Questions
Below is a list of all questions covered in this project:

### Practical: 60 Lectures
Create event driven program for following:

1. Print a table of numbers from 5 to 15 and their squares and cubes using alert.
2. Print the largest of three numbers.
3. Find the factorial of a number n.
4. Enter a list of positive numbers terminated by Zero. Find the sum and average of these numbers.
5. A person deposits Rs 1000 in a fixed account yielding 5% interest. Compute the amount in the account at the end of each year for n years.
6. Read n numbers. Count the number of negative numbers, positive numbers and zeros in the list.

### Extra Assignment Questions:
Create event driven program for following:

7. Input a string and use String Copy function.
8. Without using string function reverse a string.
9. Take a list of random numbers and bubble sort the list.
10. Take a list of random numbers and sort the list using selection sort.
11. Using searching algorithm search a number from the list.
12. Merge two given list.
13. Take an input and find if the data exists in the list.
14. Take input of user id and password and give access after proper authentication.

## Notes for Reuse

If you want to use this code for your own assignment, you mainly need to use the JavaScript files and some parts of the HTML. The CSS in this project is for design purposes only, so you may modify or exclude it as needed. However, you're welcome to use the entire code if desired. 

The homepage listing the questions is not part of the assignment; I added it for better navigation and organization. Note that the website is not optimized for mobile devices.
